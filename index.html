      <p><em>“i want to apologize to all the <strong>women</strong> i have called <strong>beautiful</strong><br>
        before i’ve called them <strong>intelligent</strong> or <strong>brave</strong><br>
        i am sorry i made it sound as though<br>
        something as simple as what you’re born with<br>
        is all you have to be proud of<br>
        when you have <strong>broken mountains</strong> with your wit<br>
        from now on i will say things like<br>
        you are resilient, or you are <strong>extraordinary</strong><br>
        not because i don’t think you’re beautiful<br>
        but because i need you to know<br>
        you are more than that.”</em><br>
