      <p>“i want to apologize to all the women i have called beautiful<br>
        before i’ve called them intelligent or brave<br>
        i am sorry i made it sound as though<br>
        something as simple as what you’re born with<br>
        is all you have to be proud of<br>
        when you have broken mountains with your wit<br>
        from now on i will say things like<br>
        you are resilient, or you are extraordinary<br>
        not because i don’t think you’re beautiful<br>
        but because i need you to know<br>
        you are more than that.”<br>
